### Example Implementation

**C# Code Snippet for Character Animation:**
```csharp
public class Character
{
    private Sprite[] idleSprites;
    private Sprite[] attackSprites;
    private int currentFrame;

    public void UpdateAnimation()
    {
        if (IsAttacking)
        {
            PlayAnimation(attackSprites);
        }
        else
        {
            PlayAnimation(idleSprites);
        }
    }

    private void PlayAnimation(Sprite[] sprites)
    {
        // Cycle through sprites for animation
        currentFrame = (currentFrame + 1) % sprites.Length;
        Render(sprites[currentFrame]);
    }
}
```

**C# Code Snippet for UI Health Bar:**
```csharp
public class HealthBar
{
    private int maxHealth;
    private int currentHealth;

    public HealthBar(int maxHealth)
    {
        this.maxHealth = maxHealth;
        this.currentHealth = maxHealth;
    }

    public void UpdateHealth(int change)
    {
        currentHealth = Math.Clamp(currentHealth + change, 0, maxHealth);
        RenderHealthBar();
    }

    private void RenderHealthBar()
    {
        float healthPercent = (float)currentHealth / maxHealth;
        // Update UI with healthPercent
    }
}
```

### Final Asset Compilation

- **Exported Assets:** All graphics, animations, and visual effects will be exported in appropriate formats (e.g., PNG for sprites, JSON for animations).
- **Documentation:** Each asset will be documented, including its purpose and how to implement it in the game engine.

This complete set of game assets is ready for implementation, ensuring a visually cohesive and engaging experience for players in **Dungeons of Eternity**.
