### AI and Behavior Systems Design Document for Dungeons of Eternity

#### 1. Overview
This document outlines the design for the AI and behavior systems to be used in Dungeons of Eternity. The focus is on enemy movement and pathfinding, boss behavior patterns, adaptive difficulty scaling, and AI decision-making systems. The goal is to create engaging and challenging AI behaviors that enhance gameplay.

#### 2. Enemy Movement and Pathfinding

##### 2.1 Movement System
- **Grid-Based Movement**: Enemies will move on a grid similar to the player's movement system. Each enemy can move a maximum of 3 tiles per turn.
- **Pathfinding Algorithm**: Implement A* pathfinding to navigate the grid efficiently. This will allow enemies to find the shortest path to the player or objectives while avoiding obstacles and traps.

##### 2.2 Behavior Tree for Enemy Movement
The behavior tree for enemy movement will contain several nodes to handle various states:

- **Selector Node**: Determines the primary action of the enemy.
  - **Sequence Node (Attack Player)**: 
    - **Check Distance**: If the player is within attack range (1 tile).
    - **Attack Action**: Execute attack card against the player.
  - **Sequence Node (Move to Player)**: 
    - **Check Distance**: If the player is outside attack range (greater than 1 tile).
    - **Calculate Path**: Use A* to determine the path to the player.
    - **Move Action**: Move along the calculated path.

##### 2.3 Example Pseudocode for Enemy Movement
```python
class EnemyAI:
    def __init__(self, enemy):
        self.enemy = enemy

    def update(self, players):
        target_player = self.find_nearest_player(players)
        if self.is_within_attack_range(target_player):
            self.attack(target_player)
        else:
            path = self.calculate_path(target_player)
            self.move_along_path(path)

    def find_nearest_player(self, players):
        # Logic to find the nearest player
        pass

    def is_within_attack_range(self, player):
        # Check if player is within attack range
        pass

    def calculate_path(self, player):
        # Use A* to calculate the path to the target player
        pass

    def move_along_path(self, path):
        # Move along the calculated path
        pass

    def attack(self, player):
        # Perform attack against the player
        pass
```

#### 3. Boss Behavior Patterns

##### 3.1 Unique Boss AI
Bosses will have distinct behavior patterns that require players to adapt their strategies. Each boss will have phases, abilities, and attack patterns.

##### 3.2 Behavior Tree for Boss AI
- **Selector Node**: Decides the boss's action based on the player's health and positioning.
  - **Sequence Node (Phase Transition)**: 
    - **Check Health**: If health is below 50%, switch to aggressive phase.
  - **Sequence Node (Attack Actions)**: 
    - **Check Distance**: If player is within attack range, perform a powerful attack.
    - **Summon Minions**: If player health is low, summon minions to distract the player.

##### 3.3 Example Pseudocode for Boss Behavior
```python
class BossAI:
    def __init__(self, boss):
        self.boss = boss
        self.phase = 1  # Initial phase

    def update(self, player):
        if self.should_transition_phase():
            self.phase += 1
        if self.phase == 1:
            self.perform_phase_one_actions(player)
        elif self.phase == 2:
            self.perform_phase_two_actions(player)

    def should_transition_phase(self):
        # Logic to determine if boss should switch phase
        pass

    def perform_phase_one_actions(self, player):
        # Actions for phase one
        pass

    def perform_phase_two_actions(self, player):
        # Actions for phase two
        pass
```

#### 4. Adaptive Difficulty Scaling

##### 4.1 Difficulty Adjustment Mechanism
The game's difficulty will adapt based on player performance, ensuring a balanced challenge.

- **Player Performance Metrics**: Track metrics such as player health, win/loss ratio, and time taken to defeat enemies.
- **Difficulty Level Adjustment**: Increase or decrease enemy health, damage, and AI aggressiveness based on metrics.
- **Dynamic Card Generation**: Adjust the rarity and power of cards available based on playerâ€™s current level and performance.

##### 4.2 Example Pseudocode for Difficulty Scaling
```python
class DifficultyManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_difficulty = 1

    def adjust_difficulty(self, player_stats):
        if player_stats.wins > 5:
            self.current_difficulty += 1
            self.scale_enemies()

    def scale_enemies(self):
        # Logic to increase enemy stats based on current difficulty
        pass
```

#### 5. AI Decision Making Systems

##### 5.1 Decision Making Framework
The AI decision-making framework will utilize a combination of behavior trees and utility systems to determine actions based on current game states.

- **Utility-Based Decisions**: Enemies will evaluate various actions based on a utility score derived from factors such as enemy health, player health, and available abilities.
  
##### 5.2 Utility Function Example
```python
def calculate_utility(enemy, player):
    health_ratio = enemy.hp / enemy.max_hp
    attack_utility = (player.hp / player.max_hp) * 10  # Example utility calculation
    return health_ratio * attack_utility

def decide_action(enemy, player):
    utility_score = calculate_utility(enemy, player)
    if utility_score > threshold:
        enemy.attack(player)
    else:
        enemy.move_away()
```

#### 6. Conclusion
The outlined AI and behavior systems for Dungeons of Eternity are designed to create a rich and engaging experience for players. By implementing intelligent enemy movement, unique boss behaviors, adaptive difficulty scaling, and robust decision-making systems, the game will provide players with a challenging yet rewarding gameplay experience. This structure not only enhances gameplay but also encourages players to adapt their strategies as they progress through the dungeons.
