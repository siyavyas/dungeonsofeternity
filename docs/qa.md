### Testing and Quality Assurance Procedures for Dungeons of Eternity

#### 1. Unit Test Specifications

**Objective**: Ensure that each component of the game functions correctly in isolation.

**Test Cases**:
- **Card Class Tests**:
  - Verify initialization of card attributes (name, card_type, rarity, mana_cost, damage, heal, effect).
  - Test the behavior of adding cards to a player's deck, ensuring limits on deck size and card rarity are enforced.
- **Player Class Tests**:
  - Validate player initialization with correct HP and mana values.
  - Test the play_card function to ensure cards can only be played with sufficient mana and correctly affect player HP or deal damage.
- **Enemy Class Tests**:
  - Confirm enemy attributes are initialized correctly.
  - Test enemy attack functionality against a player to verify damage calculation.
- **Deck Class Tests**:
  - Validate card addition and removal functionality.
  - Ensure deck size constraints are enforced and that legendary card limits are respected.

**Quality Metrics**:
- Code coverage should exceed 80%.
- All unit tests must pass without errors.

#### 2. Playtesting Protocols

**Objective**: Gather player feedback on gameplay mechanics, balance, and overall fun factor.

**Protocol Steps**:
1. **Recruit Participants**: Select a diverse group of players with varying experience levels in card-based games.
2. **Conduct Sessions**: Organize playtesting sessions focusing on specific areas (deck building, combat mechanics, puzzles).
3. **Feedback Collection**:
   - Use surveys to gather player experiences post-session.
   - Facilitate discussion groups for qualitative feedback.
4. **Iterative Testing**: Implement changes based on feedback and re-test to measure improvements.

**Quality Metrics**:
- Target a minimum satisfaction score of 4 out of 5 on gameplay enjoyment.
- Identify and address any mechanics that receive a negative feedback score of 3 or below.

#### 3. Performance Benchmarks

**Objective**: Ensure the game runs smoothly across various hardware configurations.

**Benchmarking Tests**:
- **Frame Rate Test**: Monitor the game's frame rates under various scenarios (e.g., combat, exploration with multiple enemies).
- **Load Time Test**: Measure time taken to load different game states (initial game load, transitioning between combat and exploration).
- **Memory Usage Test**: Assess the game's memory footprint during peak scenarios to ensure it does not exceed recommended limits.

**Quality Metrics**:
- Maintain a minimum of 60 FPS during combat and exploration.
- Load times should not exceed 5 seconds.
- Memory usage should not exceed 2GB on mid-range hardware.

#### 4. Bug Tracking System

**Objective**: Systematically identify, report, and resolve bugs throughout development.

**Bug Tracking Tool**: Utilize a tool like JIRA or Trello for tracking.

**Workflow**:
1. **Bug Reporting**: Encourage team members to report bugs with detailed descriptions and steps to reproduce.
2. **Prioritization**: Classify bugs by severity (critical, major, minor) and assign them to appropriate team members.
3. **Resolution Tracking**: Track the status of bugs from reported to resolved, ensuring that all critical bugs are fixed before major milestones.
4. **Post-Release Monitoring**: Continue to monitor for bugs reported by players post-launch and address them in patches.

**Quality Metrics**:
- Aim for a resolution rate of 90% of reported critical bugs within one week.
- Maintain a backlog of less than 20 unresolved minor bugs at all times.
