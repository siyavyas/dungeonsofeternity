# Comprehensive Technical Documentation Suite for Dungeons of Eternity

## 1. System Architecture Documentation

### 1.1 Overview
Dungeons of Eternity is designed using a modular architecture that separates core functionalities into distinct components. This promotes maintainability and scalability.

### 1.2 System Components
- **Game Logic Layer**: Handles all game mechanics (combat, movement, resource management).
- **Data Layer**: Manages game state, player data, and card information.
- **UI Layer**: Responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user inputs.
- **Audio Layer**: Manages background music, sound effects, and dynamic audio triggers.
- **Networking Layer**: Facilitates multiplayer functionalities (if applicable) and handles data synchronization.

### 1.3 Component Interaction
- Each layer communicates through well-defined interfaces, ensuring that changes in one component do not adversely affect others.
- Events are broadcasted to notify other components (e.g., when a player plays a card, the game logic updates the state and notifies the UI layer).
